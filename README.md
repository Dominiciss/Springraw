## Description 🗒️

This project was made to learn how to use as few dependencies as possible, but still have a solid REST api. 
I learnt how to use DataSource, and excecuteQuery/Update.
I learnt how to fetch data at spring application start, and asynchronously use the database from java with @Schedule annotation to reload() the data
fetched, and CompletableFuture to make modifications, like CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE.
